Hello everyone, nice too meet you all again. In this side I will explain a littel math material that I learn today. First let's see the general of the calculus so we can learn more about it. Calculus is a one of the subject of math learning. Not just that calculus are learn when we learning program to because we logic algorith are used at the program that we made.

# Limit

In this first material I will explain to you about the one of the subject from calculus. The subject it's Limit. Limit it self are a math system that used for combine and calculated the approach of two fungtion. this method are used to find the value from the two fungction if there got approach. In this section we will learning about infinit limit when a fungtion got approach from two different way to the value of zero. If we look closely at the image above, we can see there are two line from different way that cannot pass a line where the line have a value of zero. That's because when someone try to use a value to find the approach from the function, they will got a value that above or below zero. That's mean if we approach a function from the two different way to the value of zero, it will give the result that the value is incrase when we using more bigger or more small value to approach.

The tools that I use like Visual Studio Code, Draw.io, Flowgorithm and Compiler Assembly 8086. The tools like Visual Studio Code can run with many coding leaguange like python, HTML, Java and many other. I use Draw.io and Flowgorithm to make my flowchart.

Flowgorithm it's an app that you can use to make flowchart like Draw.io. The difference between both of them it's Flowgorithm is more better then Draw.io that's because Flowgorithm can run the flowchart so the user can know the result from the flowchart that you make.

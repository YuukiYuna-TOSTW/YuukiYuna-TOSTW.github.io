# About Deritative Rule

![fff](assets\How to Find the Derivative of the Natural Log of -x using the Chain Rule from Calculus_ ln(-x).jpg)

Hello everyone, nice too meet you all again. In this side I will explain a littel math material that I learn today. After learning about the definition and usefullness from Deritative in calculus. now we will learn about the Deritative Rules. Why we have to learn about Deritative rules ? That's because if we got a problem that not just a function, we have to use other method to solve the problem. Next I will show you all a littel Deritative Rules that we mostly use in math problem,

With see the rules from deritative above, now we can solve the math problem using the method that matching with one uf the rules. There are many different Deritative Rules that you guys can see above like Constant Rule, Constant Multiple Rule, Power Rule, Sum and Difference Rule, Product Rule, Quotient Rule, Chain Rule, Trig Deritatives, Exponential Deritative and Logarithm Deritative. For example if we got a math problem with sin, cos or tan in the problem and we have to search the Deritative from the problem then we can use the Trig Deritative Rule to solve it.

Hello everyone, nice too meet you all again. In this side I will explain a littel math material that I learn today. Before we can learn more about Deritative in Calculus, first we have to know the usefullness. The usefullness from Deritative like Finding the Slope or Rate of Change, Determining Maximum and Minimum Points (Optimization), Determining Concavity and Inflection Points, Applications in Physics and Engineering and many others. After know the usefullness from Deritative, now we can learn more about it.

A Derivative in calculus is a concept that describes the rate of change of a function with respect to its independent variable. In other words, a Derivative shows how quickly or slowly the value of a function changes as its variable changes.
Derivatives are a very important tool in calculus for understanding the change of a function. This concept is used in many fields, including physics, economics, engineering, and artificial intelligence. This time we will learn a simple Deritative operation. The operation wi talk here are the Deritative from a single function that have just a variabel and constant inside the function. We can search the Deritative with multiply the powers of number from the variabel or coefficient and decrease the power of number by one.
